# Markdown Flashcards (mdfc)

Write down your study flashcards in markdown, and use the `mdfc` command to learn them in the terminal with a spaced repetition system.

If you have worked with Anki before (especially on multiple platforms), you might know what a pain it can be to create flashcards, to tag them, to format them, and also to browse through them. I don't want to get overwhelmed by the tool. I just want to reliably learn stuff that is not simple vocabulary. And what could be easier than writing questions and answers in a markdown file?

## Features

- Write your flashcards in markdown with reliable formatting
- Adapted Leitner system with 4 difficulty levels instead of a binary system
- Study cards from one topic or all topics at once
- Study cards in sequential or random order
- Test yourself with a number of random cards in test mode

## Markdown Schema

`mdfc` automatically creates and updates the metadata of your flashcards. The following schema shows how the metadata is stored in the file:

```
# <category>

## <front_side>

<back_side>

`mdfc;box:<box>;due:<due_date>;`
```

An example file could look like the following. And btw, if you use a decent Markdown editor the file won't look so messy anymore thanks to the syntax highlighting ðŸŒˆ

```
# 1 Databases

## What does ACID stand for?

- Atomicity: transaction's operations are either all executed or none
- Consistency: database always respects all constraints
- Isolation: concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other
- Durability: once a transaction has been committed, it is permanent

## What is read-after-write consistency?

It's the ability (for every client) to view changes to a database immediately after they have been committed.

## Installation

Go to [releases]() and download the latest version for your platform. (Optional) Move the executable to a directory that is in your `PATH`. On Linux, you can use the following command: `sudo mv mdfc /usr/local/bin`.

```bash
# Run the executable
$ mdfc ./path/to/flashcards.md
$ mdfc -h
Usage: mdfc [options] [file]

Options:

	-h, --help
		Show this help message and exit.

	-s, --sequential
		Show flashcards in sequential order as in the markdown file. The default behavior is to
		show flashcards in random order.

	-c, --category <category>
		Show only flashcards of the specified category. If no category is specified, you can
		interactively choose one.
		It is possible to specify the category by a chapter number or the category's first word,
		e.g. "2.1" for "2.1 Regular Expressions".

	-o, --show-category
		Show the category of each flashcard.

	-t, --test <number_flashcards>
		Test yourself in test mode with random flashcards. If no number is specified, all
		flashcards will be tested.

	-n, --number <number_flashcards>
		Learn n cards during the session. If no number is specified, it will fall back to the
		number specified in the YAML front matter of the markdown file. Defaults to 20.

	-f, --future-days-due <days>
		Usually a flashcard is due on a particular date. If you want to learn flashcards
		before they are due, you can specify the number of days in the future when a flashcard
		should be due. This might be helpful in the case when you have no cards due for today's
		learning session. Cards where the due date was missed will be added anyway. Defaults to 0.
